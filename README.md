# 14Bis

## Project Overview
14Bis is an investment robot that employs the long & short strategy. While long & short strategies are typically used for long-term investments in longer timeframes, 14Bis stands out by applying this strategy to short-term trading.

## Project Structure
The 14Bis project is divided into several components, including:

### API
This part includes a class that manages data retrieval from MetaTrader and the fundamental aspects of backtesting.

### Analysis
The Analysis component consists of classes for cointegration testing and backtesting.

### Refactoring in Progress
The implementation of the strategy is currently being refactored, with completion expected soon.

### Notebooks
The code also contains various Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of different features.
